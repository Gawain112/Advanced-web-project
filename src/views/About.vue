      <p>
        The purpose of the web application is to provide a central repository
        for experimental data on force/tension development and sarcomere length
        shortening in the cardiomyopathic cells. The application also provides
        details relating to the type of cardiomyopathy and presents data
        visually to users when queried. All of this while providing a
        comfortable user experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        To break it down, the primary responsibilities of the web application
        are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>to enable experimental data to be submitted to the database.</li>
        <li>
          to respond to queries relating to the stored data on cardiomyopathies.
        </li>
        <li>
          to allow the querying of other existing, related databases for
          additional useful information relating to cardiomyopathies.
        </li>
        <li>
          to graph/plot appropriate experimental data for easier consumption and
          interpretation
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Other desired features of the web application:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a consistent "look and feel" throughout.</li>
        <li>creation, management and storage of user accounts.</li>
        <li>on-line help in website navigation.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The system is expected to mainly be used by clinicians, cardiologists
        and medical/healthcare experimental investigators. It will also be used
        by academic researchers, medical students and possibly cardiomyopathy
        patients with an interest in understanding the data.
